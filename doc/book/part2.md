# Part 2: Album list middleware

We will now setup a new middleware to show the album list. We will not have any
data to display just yet, but the exercise will demonstrate writing your first
middleware.

## Create the album list middleware

To begin, we will need to create the new path `src/Album/Action/`, and place a
new `AlbumListAction.php` file within it.

To create the path:

```bash
$ mkdir -p src/Album/Action
```

or use whatever tools you are comfortable with.

Now create the file `src/Album/Action/AlbumListAction.php`, with the following
contents:

```php
<?php
namespace Album\Action;

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Zend\Diactoros\Response\HtmlResponse;
use Zend\Expressive\Template\TemplateRendererInterface;

class AlbumListAction
{
    /**
     * @var TemplateRendererInterface
     */
    private $template;

    /**
     * @param TemplateRendererInterface $template
     */
    public function __construct(TemplateRendererInterface $template)
    {
        $this->template = $template;
    }

    /**
     * @param ServerRequestInterface $request
     * @param ResponseInterface      $response
     * @param callable|null          $next
     * @return HtmlResponse
     */
    public function __invoke(
        ServerRequestInterface $request,
        ResponseInterface $response,
        callable $next = null
    ) {
        $data = [];

        return new HtmlResponse(
            $this->template->render('album::list', $data)
        );
    }
}
```

Since the `AlbumListAction` needs to render a template, it depends on the
template renderer; we model that by having a `TemplateRendererInterface
$template` argument in the class constructor.

The `__invoke()` method is the middleware itself, and it creates and returns an
`HtmlResponse`. The injected template renderer is used to create the content for
the response, and renders our album list template.  Since we have no data to
output yet, an empty array is passed to the renderer.

> ### Interfaces and classes used
> 
> Some of the interfaces and classes referenced in the above example may look
> unfamiliar; below are details on each.
> 
> - The `Psr\Http\Message` namespace contains a set of standardized HTTP 
>   message interfaces which are also known as [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).
>   Many PHP frameworks and open source projects consume these interfaces within
>   their projects, as they provide a convenient and interoperable abstraction
>   around HTTP messages.
>   
> - The component [`Zend\Diactoros`](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros) 
>   contains a PSR-7 implementation provided by the Zend Framework project, and
>   is the default implementation used by Expressive.
>   
> - `HtmlResponse` is a convenience class for creating HTTP responses with HTML
>   content. By default, these responses have a 200 HTTP status code and a
>   Content-Type set to `text/html`. 
> 
>   Note that the `HtmlResponse` class also accepts a status code and headers as
>   additional arguments. You can seed your instance with the status code and
>   headers present in the response instance passed to the middleware if
>   desired:
> 
>   ```php
>   return new HtmlResponse(
>       $this->template->render('album::list', $data),
>       $response->getStatusCode(), 
>       $response->getHeaders()
>   );
>   ```

> ### Middleware typehints
>
> Most examples in this tutorial will use typehinting for the middleware:
>
> ```php
> public function __invoke(
>     ServerRequestInterface $request,
>     ResponseInterface $response,
>     callable $next = null
> )
> ```
>
> This can be somewhat cumbersome and repetitious when writing your code. As
> such, you will often see middleware examples that omit the typehints:
>
> ```php
> public function __invoke($request, $response, $next)
> ```
>
> When you see such code, keep the typehints from the previous example in mind.

## Create a factory for the album list middleware

In order to work, the `AlbumListAction` requires a `TemplateRendererInterface`
instance. How can we ensure one is injected? Create a factory, and inform the
container about it!

At this time, create the file `AlbumListFactory.php` within 
the same directory as the `AlbumListAction` class file, with the following
contents:

```php
<?php
namespace Album\Action;

use Interop\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Zend\Expressive\Template\TemplateRendererInterface;

class AlbumListFactory
{
    /**
     * @param ContainerInterface $container
     * @return AlbumListAction
     */
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container)
    {
        $template = $container->get(TemplateRendererInterface::class);
        return new AlbumListAction($template);
    }
}
```

The `__invoke()` method defines a factory for creating and returning an
`AlbumListAction` instance. Internally, it fetches a template renderer instance
from the DI container using the interface name, and the returned value is passed
to the `AlbumListAction` constructor.

Projects can assign their desired template renderer implementation to the
service named after the interface, allowing the ability to swap implementations
and ensure interoperability.

We can now use this factory to create an `AlbumListAction` instance.

> ### container-interop
> 
> `Interop\Container\ContainerInterface` is provided by the [container-interop]
> (https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop) package,
> which tries to standardize features in container objects 
> (service locators, dependency injection containers, etc.) to achieve 
> interoperability.

> ### Factory typehints
>
> Most examples in this tutorial will use typehinting for factories:
>
> ```php
> public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container)
> ```
>
> For simplicity, and interoperability, many developers omit the typehint:
>
> ```php
> public function __invoke($container)
> ```
>
> This is particularly true for users of zend-servicemanager; that project, prior to the
> 2.6.0 release, did not implement `ContainerInterface`, though its signature
> was compatible. As such, omitting the typehint allowed re-use of factories.
>
> When you see such code, keep the typehints from the first example in mind.

## Create a template for listing albums

We now need a template file for the album list. First, create
the path `templates/album/`:

```bash
$ mkdir -p templates/album/
```

(or use whatever filesystem tools you're familiar with)

Now, place a new `list.phtml` file within that path, with the following
contents:

```php
<?php $this->layout('layout::default', ['title' => 'Albums']) ?>

<div class="jumbotron">
    <h1>Album list</h1>
</div>
```

This template sets the title of the page, and prints the heading within a
div that is styled by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Please note, 
that there is no echo needed for the `$this->layout()` call since the
output of the page title is done within the layout file 
(`templates/layout/default.phtml`).

## Tell the application about the middleware and template

Currently, our Expressive application is unaware of the new action and template.
Let's route our middleware and notify zend-view of our template.

Create a file named `album.global.php` file in the directory `config/autoload/`,
with the following contents:

```php
<?php
return [
    'dependencies' => [
        'factories' => [
            Album\Action\AlbumListAction::class => Album\Action\AlbumListFactory::class,
        ],
    ],

    'routes' => [
        [
            'name' => 'album',
            'path' => '/album',
            'middleware' => Album\Action\AlbumListAction::class,
            'allowed_methods' => ['GET'],
        ],
    ],

    'templates' => [
        'paths' => [
            'album' => [ 'templates/album' ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

- Within the `dependencies` configuration section you can configure the
  DI container (zend-servicemanager in our project). We use the class name of
  the new `AlbumListAction` as the service identifier, and the class name of the
  `AlbumListFactory` as the factory that will return an instance for that
  service.

- Within the `routes` configuration section you can map path specifications to
  middleware. The configuration above defines the route named `album`, with the
  path `/album`, and maps it to our new `AlbumListAction` middleware.  It also
  restricts access to GET requests for this route.
  
- Within the `templates` configuration section, we configure the paths
  for the templates and map them to virtual namespaces. In the above, we've
  mapped the template namespace `album` to the path `templates/album/`.
  This allows the template `album::list` to map to the template file
  `templates/album/list.phtml`.

## Provide navigation

How will users know the new page exists? Let's add a link to the new page within
the menu.

Open the `templates/layout/default.phtml` file and add the link to the album 
list by using the name of the route we configured in the previous section:

```
<body class="app">
    <header class="app-header">
        <nav class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
            <div class="container">
                <!-- ... -->
                <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
                    <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
                        <!-- ... -->
                        <li>
                            <a href="<?= $this->url('album') ?>">
                                <i class="fa fa-music"></i> Album
                            </a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <!-- ... -->
</body>
```

## Write tests

Development should be accompanied by tests. Let's create some initial tests for
our middleware.

First, create the directory `test/AlbumTest/Action/`:

```bash
$ mkdir -p test/AlbumTest/Action/
```

(or use the filesystem tools you are familiar with)

Now create the file `AlbumListActionTest.php` in this new path. This test case
should test the action we just created, and specifically that it returns an
instance of `Zend\Diactoros\Response\HtmlResponse` with expected content. 

Add the following content to the file `test/AlbumTest/Action/AlbumListActionTest.php`:

```php
<?php
namespace AlbumTest\Action;

use Album\Action\AlbumListAction;
use PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase as TestCase;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Zend\Diactoros\Response\HtmlResponse;
use Zend\Expressive\Template\TemplateRendererInterface;

class AlbumListActionTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * @var ServerRequestInterface
     */
    private $request;

    /**
     * @var ResponseInterface
     */
    private $response;

    /**
     * @var callable
     */
    private $next;

    /**
     * Setup test case
     */
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->request  = $this->prophesize(ServerRequestInterface::class);
        $this->response = $this->prophesize(ResponseInterface::class);

        $this->next = function () {
        };
    }

    /**
     * Test if action renders the album list
     */
    public function testActionRendersAlbumListTemplate()
    {
        $renderer = $this->prophesize(TemplateRendererInterface::class);
        $renderer
            ->render('album::list', [])
            ->shouldBeCalled()
            ->willReturn('BODY');

        $action = new AlbumListAction($renderer->reveal());

        $response = $action(
            $this->request->reveal(),
            $this->response->reveal(),
            $this->next
        );

        $this->assertInstanceOf(HtmlResponse::class, $response);
        $this->assertEquals('BODY', $response->getBody());
    }
}
```

While it may seem unnecessary, we will also create a test for the factory. This
ensures that as you make changes to your class, dependencies, or instantiation,
you don't introduce bugs!

Create the file `AlbumListFactoryTest.php` in the same path as the previous
test, and write a test verifying the factory returns an `AlbumListAction`
instance: 

```php
<?php

namespace AlbumTest\Action;

use Album\Action\AlbumListAction;
use Album\Action\AlbumListFactory;
use Interop\Container\ContainerInterface;
use PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase as TestCase;
use Zend\Expressive\Template\TemplateRendererInterface;

class AlbumListFactoryTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * @var ContainerInterface
     */
    protected $container;

    /**
     * Setup test case
     */
    protected function setUp()
    {
        $this->container = $this->prophesize(ContainerInterface::class);
    }

    /**
     * Test if factory returns the correct action
     */
    public function testFactoryReturnsAlbumListAction()
    {
        $this->container
            ->get(TemplateRendererInterface::class)
            ->willReturn(
                $this->prophesize(TemplateRendererInterface::class)->reveal()
            );

        $factory = new AlbumListFactory();
        $this->assertTrue($factory instanceof AlbumListFactory);

        $action = $factory($this->container->reveal());
        $this->assertTrue($action instanceof AlbumListAction);
    }
}
```

## Add autoloading

In order to use the new classes we've created, we need to ensure our autoloader
can find them! We can do this in the `composer.json` file by adding the new
`Album` namespace and mapping it to the `src/Album/` path. Open that file, and
update the `autoload.psr4` section to read as follows:

```javascript
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "src/App/",
            "Album\\": "src/Album/"
        }
    },
}
```

You will also need to map the `AlbumTest` namespace to the `test/AlbumTest/`
path; however, this only needs to be done for *development*, and, as such, we'll
add the entry to the `autoload-dev.psr4` section of the `composer.json`:

```javascript
{
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-4": {
            "AppTest\\": "test/AppTest/",
            "AlbumTest\\": "test/AlbumTest/"
        }
    },
}
```

Note: do not add or remove anything else! When you get done, run `composer
validate` to ensure the changes you made are still valid.

Adding the entry only tells Composer about the autoloading, but does not update
the autoloader. To do that, run the following command:

```bash
$ composer dump-autoload
```

## Setup PHPUnit

Setting up [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing is quite simple.  Edit the
`phpunit.xml.dist` file in the project root, and add the album test directory to
the test suite:

```xml
<phpunit bootstrap="./vendor/autoload.php" colors="true">
    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="App\\Tests">
            <directory>./test/AppTest</directory>
        </testsuite>
        <testsuite name="Album\\Tests">
            <directory>./test/AlbumTest</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>

    <filter>
        <whitelist processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true">
            <directory suffix=".php">src</directory>
        </whitelist>
    </filter>
</phpunit>
```

To run the tests, execute the following from the project root:

```
$ phpunit
```

## Browse to the album list

Now that we have verified programmatically what we've written, let's see what we
get in the browser!

If you do not have the built-in web server running, fire it up now:

```bash
$ composer serve
```

Now browse to [http://localhost:8080/album](http://localhost:8080/album) to see if the 
album page was setup properly.

## Compare with example repository branch `part2`

You can compare your code with the example repository when looking at the branch
`part2`. If you want you can even clone it and have a deeper look.
